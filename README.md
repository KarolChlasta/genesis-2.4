genesis-2.4
===========

Repository for continued development of the GENESIS 2.4 neural simulator
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The files here are based on the November 11, 2014 public release of
GENESIS 2.4, available from http://genesis-sim.org/GENESIS. The directory
'genesis' contains these, with any changes made since that time.

The 'pgenesis' directory contains development versions of parallel
GENESIS (PGENESIS) version 2.4, updated from version 2.3.1. Not all
features of GENESIS 2.4 have yet been incorporated into PGENESIS 2.4.

The December 6, 2014 update contains new documentation and compiled binaries for
using GENESIS under MS Windows with Cygwin.

The December 11, 2016 update contains source code (in genesis/src/newconn) for
'facdep_rules', a new hsolveable short term facilitation/depression synaptic
plasticity object. Documentation is in genesis/Doc/facdep_rules.txt.

The 'genesis-binaries' directory contains pre-compilied binary
distributions, such as 'genesis-binaries/genesis-2.4-Cygwin-bin.tar.gz'.
